Hey Ms sunshine,

I don’t even know where to start, because the pride I feel for you isn’t the kind that can be summed up in words easily. I’m not just proud of what you do, or what you’ve achieved, though those things are incredible. I’m proud of you ..the person you are becoming, the journey you are courageously walking, the way you face every single day with your heart open, even when it’s not easy.

Your smile..it might be regular to some, but to me, it’s everything. The world gets to see it every day, and that smile you carry is so important. It matters more than you realize, because it inspires, uplifts, and touches the people around you in ways you may never know. I see you. I see the effort you put in every morning, the determination to tackle your day, the moments when you push through even when you’re tired or unsure. I see you, Poppie. And I am so, so proud of you.

You are vital. You matter. You are needed.this world that is brighter because you exist. Your presence is important, your heart is important, and you yourself are irreplaceable. Never forget that.

And through it all, I want you to know something simple but true.. no matter what happens, no matter where life takes you, I will always be here for you. Always. 

Keep being you, ms sunshine. Keep shining. Keep moving forward. And remember, I am endlessly proud of you, and endlessly here for you.
